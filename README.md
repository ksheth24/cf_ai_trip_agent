# Travel Agent

This is a Travel Agent AI powered Agentic AI framework built using Cloudflare's Agent platform. Combined with the starter template and powerful tools, this project has an interactive chat experience with an AI travel agent. 

## Features

- Interactive chat interface with AI
- Dark/Light theme support
- Real-time streaming responses
- State management and chat history
- Modern, responsive UI
- Trip planning capability that allows the AI Agent to plan a trip based off of user provided info
- Email functionality that emails itinerary to you and your travel buddies
- Google maps connection that provides you with Google Maps links to all activities/restaurants


## How to Use

1. Navigate to the deployed link: https://agents-starter.keshavsheth11.workers.dev/

2. Start your chat with the agent!
 - Let's first invoke the Trip Planner tool: Tell the agent where you want to go for your trip and the start and end dates of the trip. Feel free to provide the agent with information regarding who you are traveling with, your personal interests, and any other information for a customized experience!

 - Read through the provided itinerary and let the agent know of any changes you would like to make

 - Once you like your itinerary, ask the agent to generate Google Maps links for all the activities/restaurants it planned for you. The agent will now parse through the entire itinerary it created and find these places on Google Maps automatically. *NOTE* Make sure to click on the text as these are the links

 - Finally, send this completed itinerary + all Google Maps links to yourself and your travel buddies by providing the agent with the everyone's email addresses and instructing it to send the travel details to this location *NOTE* It is VERY likely that this email was sent to your spam folder so check there for an email from keshavsheth11@gmail.com

 Congratulations! You have used the Travel Agent to plan an amazing trip for yourself and your friends/family!

## Custom Tools Created
1. PlanTrip: This tool leverages the OpenAI API to create a custom tailored trip itinerary for your desired trip. After providing this tool with a start date, end date, travel destination, and personal interests, the tool feeds this information into OpenAI LLM model to create a travel itinerary. The tool is designed so that the model will always output the itinerary in a way that separates the activities for each day and provides restaurant and recommendations for each day.

2. sendEmail: This tool leverages SendGrid API to send the created travel itinerary to travel buddies. After the user provides the emails of whoever needs to receive the email, the agent will parse through this data and make respective API calls. All emails are sent from keshavsheth11@gmail.com

3. generateMapLinks: This tool strategically parses through the itinerary generated by the LLM and isolates all activities/restaurants that were planned. Then, this information is passed into Google Maps and a unique Google Maps link is generated for each activity/restaurant. 


### Example Use Case

1. **Planning a family trip**
   - Provide the agent with everyone in the family you are going with and the interests of the group
   - The Agent will automatically generate Google Maps links for each activity & restaurant that is planned, making sure you always know where you are going
   - Share your exciting plans with your family! Provide the agent with the email addresses of everyone to share what you have created
